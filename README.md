## How to set up the code on your machine

* Step 1: Open up the terminal on your machine.
* Step 2: Move to the directory where you want to set up the code.
* Step 3: Paste the following command: `git clone https://github.com/wiplane/foundations-of-datascience-ml.git`
* Step 4: A folder titled `foundations-of-datascience-mlfoundations-of` will be created where all the code resides.
* Step 5: Set up the conda environment using the `.yaml` file or as shown in the first module of the course.
* Start running the notebooks.

## Disclaimer

* A few of the notebooks or slides may be slightly different from what we ended up with in the lectures. Don't bother too much about the changes, I must be trying something new there.
* Slides are added only for the important lectures. Not all lectures included slides
* [WIP]: I am refining the assignments/exercises for a few modules. I've talked about the kind of problems you should try to solve in the outro of a few final lectures, I just need to put it together in writing for you. Should be done very soon.
* If you encounter some error/inconsistency in  my code/explanation, feel free to reach out or comment at the bottom of the lecture.
